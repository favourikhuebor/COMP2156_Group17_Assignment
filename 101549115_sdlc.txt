Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is essential for improving efficiency, collaboration, and automation 
in software development and deployment. 
It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases.

By integrating CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines, 
DevOps enables automated testing, early bug detection, and seamless code integration, reducing deployment failures. 
It also enhances scalability, monitoring, and security, ensuring that software meets business and user requirements efficiently. 

An interesting fact about the SDLC is that its origins can be traced back to the 1960s, 
when early software engineering practices were formalized to manage complex software projects. 
Initially, the Waterfall model was the dominant approach, emphasizing a linear, structured process. 
However, as software development evolved, new SDLC models like Agile, DevOps, and Lean emerged to address the need for flexibility, faster iterations, and continuous improvement. Today, modern SDLC frameworks integrate automation, cloud computing, and AI-driven testing, significantly accelerating development cycles and improving software quality.
