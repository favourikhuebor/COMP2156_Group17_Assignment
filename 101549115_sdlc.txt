Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is essential for improving efficiency, collaboration, and automation 
in software development and deployment. 
It bridges the gap between development and operations teams, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases.

By integrating CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines, 
DevOps enables automated testing, early bug detection, and seamless code integration, reducing deployment failures. 
It also enhances scalability, monitoring, and security, ensuring that software meets business and user requirements efficiently.
