Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. 
DevOps plays a crucial role in optimizing SDLC by introducing automation and collaboration.

Phases of SDLC:
1. Planning - Identifying project requirements and scope.
2. Analysis - Understanding user needs and system specifications.
3. Design - Creating system architecture and software design.
4. Development - Writing code and building the application.
5. Testing - Identifying and fixing errors before deployment.
6. Deployment - Releasing the software to production.
7. Maintenance - Updating and maintaining the software.

How DevOps Enhances SDLC:
- Automates processes to improve efficiency.
- Implements Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to detect and fix errors quickly.
- Promotes collaboration between development and operations teams.
- Increases reliability and quality of software products.

By integrating DevOps into SDLC, organizations can achieve faster development cycles, better collaboration, and higher software quality.
